/*
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

// Two pointer solution

const hasCycle = function(head) {
  if (!head) return false;
  var faster = head;
  var slower = head;
  while (faster && faster.next) {
    faster = faster.next.next;
    slower = slower.next;
    if (slower === faster) return true;
  }
  return false;
};
